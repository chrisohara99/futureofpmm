            <p>With AI writing copy, generating competitive analysis, and even drafting positioning statements, it's natural to wonder: what's left for us humans? After 20 years in product marketing, here's what I believe will remain uniquely human skills — at least for the foreseeable future.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Strategic Judgment Under Ambiguity</h2>
            <p>AI excels at pattern recognition and optimization when objectives are clear. But product marketing often requires making decisions with incomplete information, conflicting signals, and no clear "right answer."</p>
            <p>Should you position against the market leader or ignore them? Is this analyst's criticism worth addressing or noise to filter out? Will this messaging resonate with the CFO or the end user first?</p>
            <p>These judgment calls require understanding context, politics, and nuance that AI can't grasp. The best PMMs develop an intuition for these decisions over years of experience.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Skill to develop:</strong> Practice articulating your reasoning for strategic decisions. The more you make your implicit judgment explicit, the better you'll get at it — and the more valuable you'll be.
            </div>
            
            <h2>2. Cross-Functional Influence</h2>
            <p>PMMs sit at the intersection of product, sales, marketing, and customer success. Our job often involves convincing people who don't report to us to do things they might not want to do.</p>
            <p>Getting the sales team excited about new messaging. Pushing back on product when launch timing doesn't work. Aligning marketing on positioning before the campaign kicks off.</p>
            <p>This requires relationship building, political savvy, and persuasion skills that no AI can replicate. You need to read the room, understand motivations, and adapt your approach to each stakeholder.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Skill to develop:</strong> Map your key stakeholders and what they care about. Practice adjusting your communication style for different audiences. Build genuine relationships, not just transactional ones.
            </div>
            
            <h2>3. Customer Empathy & Insight Synthesis</h2>
            <p>AI can analyze thousands of support tickets or sales calls. But understanding <em>why</em> customers feel the way they do — and translating that into positioning that resonates — requires human empathy.</p>
            <p>The best positioning comes from deeply understanding customer pain, aspirations, and the language they use to describe their world. This requires listening between the lines, picking up on emotional subtext, and connecting dots across disparate conversations.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Skill to develop:</strong> Spend more time with customers directly. Don't just read transcripts — sit in on calls, visit customer sites, feel their frustration firsthand. There's no substitute for primary research.
            </div>
            
            <h2>4. Narrative Construction</h2>
            <p>AI can write decent copy, but crafting a compelling narrative arc — one that builds tension, creates emotional resonance, and drives action — remains a human art.</p>
            <p>The best product launches tell a story. They have a villain (the status quo), a hero (the customer), and a guide (your product). They build anticipation and deliver satisfying resolution.</p>
            <p>This kind of storytelling requires creativity, cultural awareness, and an understanding of what makes humans tick that AI hasn't mastered.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Skill to develop:</strong> Study storytelling outside of marketing. Read novels, watch great films, analyze speeches. Understand narrative structure and practice applying it to your work.
            </div>
            
            <h2>5. Managing Up & Organizational Navigation</h2>
            <p>Can AI help you prepare for a board presentation? Sure. Can it navigate the politics of getting your CEO aligned on positioning before they go off-script in an earnings call? Absolutely not.</p>
            <p>Understanding organizational dynamics, managing expectations, and ensuring leadership alignment requires human judgment about human systems.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Skill to develop:</strong> Pay attention to how decisions actually get made in your organization (not how they're supposed to). Build relationships with people above and around you, not just below.
            </div>
            
            <h2>The Meta-Skill: Knowing When to Use AI</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the most important skill of all: knowing when to leverage AI and when to rely on human judgment. The best PMMs will develop a sense for which tasks benefit from AI acceleration and which require the human touch.</p>
            
            <p>AI is a tool, not a replacement. The PMMs who thrive will be those who use it to handle the grunt work, freeing them up for the strategic, relational, and creative work that machines can't do.</p>
            
            <p>Focus your development on these irreplaceable skills, and you'll remain valuable regardless of how capable AI becomes.</p>
