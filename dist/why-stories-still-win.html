        </figure>

        <p>Douwe Bergsma, CMO of Georgia-Pacific, walked into our meeting with a question that stopped me cold.</p>
        
        <p>"You may be wondering why a company that sells toilet paper, paper towels, and napkins needs a data management platform." He paused, just long enough to let the absurdity land. "We thought perhaps you could tell us."</p>
        
        <p>I've been in a lot of conference rooms over the past twenty years—pitching DMPs, then CDPs, now agentic AI—and Douwe's question captures something I've never quite been able to shake. The most important transformations in business are, on paper, spectacularly boring. Data management platforms. Identity resolution. Journey orchestration. API response latency optimization. Try explaining any of that at a dinner party. I dare you.</p>
        
        <p>And yet I've watched billion-dollar decisions stall because the people who needed to make them couldn't connect the technical capability to the business outcome. The technology matters. The architecture matters. But none of it moves without a story that makes someone <em>feel</em> why it matters.</p>
        
        <p>That's what this essay is about: ten stories from three books and nearly a decade of trying to make the technical human. Some of them worked. Some of them taught me something I didn't expect. All of them stuck.</p>

        <hr class="section-break">

        <h2>The Oldest Technology</h2>
        
        <p>Before I get to the stories, a confession: I think about Joseph Campbell more than any marketing executive probably should.</p>
        
        <p>Campbell spent his life studying the monomyth—the Hero's Journey—and what he found was that the same narrative structure appears independently across every culture on earth. A hero is called to adventure, crosses into the unknown, faces trials, meets mentors, confronts death, returns transformed. You've seen it a thousand times. <em>Star Wars</em>. <em>The Matrix</em>. Every Pixar movie. Every Hallmark Christmas film—though in those the "death" is usually just moving back to the small town where your high school sweetheart still runs the tree farm.</p>
        
        <p>My co-author Martin Kihn wrote about narrative weaponization in <em>House of Lies</em>, exploring how consultants use story to sell ideas that spreadsheets alone could never move. The insight wasn't cynical—it was honest. Humans don't process data the way we process stories. Data informs. Stories transform.</p>
        
        <p>We're wired for it. Two million years of sitting around fires, passing survival knowledge through narrative, will do that to a species.</p>
        
        <p>Steve Jobs understood this. He didn't sell MP3 players. He sold "a thousand songs in your pocket." Salesforce didn't sell CRM software. They sold "no software"—a vision of a world without the pain of enterprise IT. When I started writing <em>Data Driven</em> in 2017, I had a choice: write a technical manual about data platforms, or tell stories about the people using data to transform their businesses. I could explain identity graphs, or I could tell you about Mike Cunningham's dream of putting a $5 chip in every Keurig coffee maker.</p>
        
        <p>The technical manual would have been accurate. The stories were memorable.</p>

        <hr class="section-break">

        <h2>The Stories</h2>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>1. The $5 Chip</h3>
            <p>In 2015, Mike Cunningham—Chief Digital Officer at Keurig Green Mountain—had a vision that I still think about. Put a data collection chip in every coffee maker. Optical scanner to identify K-Cups. Bluetooth beacon to detect mobile devices. LCD screen for targeted messages. "Can you tell me what it's worth?" he asked.</p>
            <p>The math worked. You could move from "Walmart ordered 50,000 K-Cups" to knowing that Dad drinks dark roast Sumatra at 6am, Mom prefers French Hazelnut at 7:30, and the twelve-year-old sneaks Donut Shop K-Cups on weekends when nobody's watching.</p>
            <p>Keurig decided not to build it.</p>
            <p>But here's the thing: if Mike asked me today, I'd give him completely different advice. "You don't need the chip. The customer's agent already knows all of that." The question isn't "how do we discover the customer?" anymore. It's "how do we become the brand the customer's agent chooses by default?"</p>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>2. Casey's Pizza</h3>
            <p>Casey's General Stores partnered with an agency called Boom Boom Jones—yes, that's real—on something deceptively simple: personalized emails to lapsed pizza customers. The innovation? Put a picture of <em>the customer's usual order</em> in the email. Not a stock photo. <em>Their</em> pizza. 300% lift in conversion.</p>
            <p>I used to tell this story as a pure win. But writing <em>The Agentic Customer</em> made me realize something: that personalized pizza picture was optimized for human psychology. An AI agent doesn't feel nostalgia. The 300% lift was real, but it was real for humans.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>3. The Toilet Paper Question</h3>
            <p>Georgia-Pacific didn't have CRM records for the millions of people buying Brawny at Walmart. The challenge in 2017 was figuring out how to capture data about customers you never directly touch.</p>
            <p>The challenge in 2026 is different: how do you make your products machine-readable when the customer's agent is doing the shopping? Same company, same products, completely different question.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>4. Campbell's Weather</h3>
            <p>Campbell's Soup Company has been using weather data to direct marketing budgets since the 1950s. Seventy years of institutional knowledge. But the agent doesn't care about your institutional knowledge. It cares about structured data, real-time availability, and competitive pricing—right now.</p>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>5. Pandora's Playlist</h3>
            <p>Pandora discovered that your playlist reveals almost everything about you. This is Principle #2 from <em>Data Driven</em> in action: you have more data than you think. It's also one of the only principles that translates cleanly into the agentic era—because an agent can do the same inference, just faster.</p>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>6. The Porsche on the Tarmac</h3>
            <p>My family was about to miss a connection in Atlanta—entire vacation to St. Thomas at risk—so I tweeted @Delta. They met us at the gate and whisked us between concourses in a Porsche Macan. What was that worth? I may never book another airline again.</p>
            <p>This is what unified customer data actually <em>feels</em> like. Not a dashboard. A moment where everything a company knows about you comes together to save your vacation.</p>

        <p>Let me skip ahead to the three stories that keep me up at night—the ones that suggest the rules might be changing faster than most companies realize.</p>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>7. The Inverted Bullseye</h3>
            <p>Ronald den Elzen—CEO of Heineken USA—drew a bullseye: 320 million Americans → 18-20 million Heineken lovers. <em>"Can you help me find these people?"</em></p>
            <p>Now imagine the bullseye inverted. A customer's agent broadcasting <em>out</em>: preferences, budget, values. The agent isn't waiting to be found. Ronald's question becomes: "Can you help me <em>be found</em>?"</p>

        </div>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>8. Apex Home Goods</h3>
            <p>They built everything my books prescribed. Eight figures invested. Level 4 maturity. The CMO presented at conferences. Then in 2025, the metrics plateaued—because their customers had delegated to AI agents. The beautiful customer experience? The agent couldn't see it.</p>
            <p>Doing everything right for the last paradigm doesn't protect you from the next one.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>9. Joe Then and Now</h3>
            <p>In 2018, Joe's car-buying journey touched dozens of systems. Chaos. In 2026, Joe's agent queried twelve manufacturers in seconds, negotiated with dealers, and Joe walked into one dealership already approved. The question isn't "how do we track the journey?" anymore. There's no journey to track.</p>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h3>10. Father Schmitt's Mainframe</h3>
            <p>In 1961, Father Theodore Schmitt computerized his donor records on an IBM 650 mainframe. His mainframe processed dozens of records per hour. An AI agent evaluates dozens of brands per second. Six orders of magnitude faster. But the logic didn't change at all.</p>
            <p>The technology changes; the principles compound.</p>
            <p><a href="articles/stories/10-father-schmitts-mainframe.html">Read the full story →</a></p>
        </div>

        <hr class="section-break">

        <p>The agentic revolution will transform commerce—I believe it's the most significant shift in our lifetimes—but agents don't set preferences. Humans do. The customer who tells their agent "I only buy from sustainable brands" got that value somewhere. Brand story influences how humans configure their agents. The story happens <em>before</em> the agent gets involved.</p>
        
        <p>The companies that win won't just have the best APIs. They'll have the clearest stories about why their transformation matters—stories that move executives to invest, employees to execute, and humans to tell their agents which brands to trust.</p>
        
        <p>Data advantage is temporary. Someone will always have more data, fresher data, better data. But story advantage compounds. Father Schmitt understood that in 1961. Douwe Bergsma understood it when he walked into that conference room with his impossible question about toilet paper. The agents don't care about stories—but the people programming the agents still do.</p>
        
        <p>That's why stories still win.</p>
