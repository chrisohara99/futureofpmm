New year, new predictions. Here's what we think happens in product marketing this year.

## 1. "AI-Powered" Becomes Meaningless

By Q3, every product will claim AI features. The phrase "AI-powered" will have zero differentiation value. Smart PMMs will stop leading with it and start leading with *outcomes*.

**Watch for:** Messaging that focuses on what the AI *does*, not that it exists.

## 2. PMM Headcount Flat, Output Up

Companies won't mass-fire PMMs, but they won't backfill departures either. Remaining PMMs will cover more ground with AI assistance. Expect 1.5x output from the same team size.

**Watch for:** "Do more with less" becoming normalized.

## 3. The Rise of the PMM-Engineer

A new archetype emerges: the PMM who can build their own AI workflows. Not writing code, but chaining tools, building prompts, automating pipelines. They'll be disproportionately valuable.

**Watch for:** Job posts asking for "AI fluency" or "automation experience."

## 4. Customer Research Renaissance

With content creation accelerated, the bottleneck moves to *insights*. PMMs who can generate original customer understanding will be worth more than PMMs who can just package it.

**Watch for:** More PMM time in Gong, more customer interviews, more field time.

## 5. One Major AI Messaging Disaster

Some company will let AI generate customer-facing content without review. It'll go wrong — factually, tonally, or legally. The backlash will reinforce human-in-the-loop workflows.

**Watch for:** The inevitable "AI gone wrong" news cycle.

## Our Bet

The PMMs who win 2026 will be **ambidextrous**: fluent in AI tools *and* deeply connected to customers. The ones who lean too far either direction will struggle.

Let's check back in December.
