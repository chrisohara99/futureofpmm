## 📝 Friday Note

Welcome to the first Friday note focused on the future of PMM — a resource that will continually look at how AI will impact our jobs as product marketers.

This week I focused on looking at the **37 distinct things the Pragmatic Institute identifies as our roles and responsibilities** — and stack ranked which ones might eventually be replaced, enhanced, or left alone by AI.

This newsletter links to a site with lots of great information, including recent news, an ongoing AI tools review and analysis, a comprehensive guide to how SAP is publicly marketing our AI capabilities, and some great use cases and real-life examples of how we are putting AI to work!

Enjoy!

## [⚡ Featured: AI Impact on the 37 PMM Skills](https://futureofpmm.com/pmm-skills-ai-impact.html)

### Which PMM Activities Will AI Replace?

I analyzed every activity in **Pragmatic Institute's product lifecycle framework** and scored them for AI replacement probability.

**The results:**
- **7 activities** are likely to be replaced by AI (85-95% score)
- **24 activities** will be enhanced by AI (50-75% score)  
- **6 activities** will never be fully replaced (20-40% score)

**Top 3 most at-risk:**
1. 🔴 **Competitive Landscape** (95%) — AI monitors competitors 24/7
2. 🔴 **Content Creation** (92%) — 30-50% faster with AI
3. 🔴 **Lead Nurturing** (91%) — End-to-end automation

**Most AI-resistant:**
1. 🟢 **Events** (20%) — Physical presence can't be automated
2. 🟢 **Distinctive Competencies** (30%) — Requires institutional self-awareness
3. 🟢 **Advocacy** (32%) — Human relationships drive references

Each skill includes tool recommendations, evidence, and sources.
