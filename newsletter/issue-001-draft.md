# The Future of PMM
## Issue #1 — Friday, February 14, 2026

---

## 📝 Friday Note

This week I had the chance to sit down with **David Yockelson**, a Research VP and Gartner Fellow who leads their product marketing practice. The conversation gave me the clearest framework I've seen for thinking about where and how to deploy AI across PMM activities.

The big insight? **Not all AI investments are equal** — and the framework he walked me through (Defend / Extend / Upend) maps different activities to different competitive ambitions, return profiles, and investment levels.

We're also running two surveys right now — Gartner's and [our own AI Tools assessment](https://futureofpmm.com/ai-survey.html). Take both if you haven't already. We'll use the results to build a prioritized transformation roadmap.

Enjoy!

## 📋 Action Required: Gartner Product Marketing Skills Assessment

As Dan mentioned, we've partnered with Gartner to conduct a brief, anonymous skills assessment that benchmarks our function against other technology organizations.

**The assessment covers 18 product marketing activities across five core areas:**
- Understanding the market
- Knowing your audience
- Communicating value
- Enabling go-to-market teams
- Managing product marketing teams

This is not a performance review or individual evaluation, so please be open with your responses as it will help us calibrate and identify the PMM capabilities training we need to provide to you.

**To reiterate:**
- ✅ Individual responses are anonymous; we will not see who selected which answers.
- ✅ Gartner will only know if someone participated, not your individual responses.
- ✅ Your input directly informs our priorities for capability development, tooling, and enablement.

**You should have received an email from Gartner yesterday** inviting you to complete the Product Marketing Score assessment. Please take the time to complete it if you haven't already.

## [⚡ Featured: What Gartner Gets Right About AI in Product Marketing](https://futureofpmm.com/gartner-ai-product-marketing.html)

### And the One Thing They're Missing

I sat down with **David Yockelson** — a Research VP and Gartner Fellow who leads Gartner's product marketing practice — to figure out how we should think about deploying AI agents across our teams.

**The Framework: Defend / Extend / Upend**

Gartner maps PMM activities into three buckets based on competitive ambition:

🛡️ **Defend** (Parity)
- Augmenting individual productivity
- Content generation lives here
- Investment: ~$500/worker/year (Copilot tier)
- Return: "Return on Employee"

📈 **Extend** (Differentiation)  
- Transforming processes for competitive advantage
- Example: AI-powered continuous competitive intel
- Investment: $250K - $5M (project-level)
- Return: Actual financial ROI

🚀 **Upend** (Disruption)
- Creating new products, markets, value props
- Cross-functional GTM workflows, agentic AI
- Investment: $20M - $250M+
- Return: "Return on Future"

**Key Insight:** Each PMM activity has its own trajectory. Content = AI-led now. Persona development = build, don't buy. ICP refinement = human-led migrating to hybrid.

**The real prize?** Not the activities themselves — it's what happens *between* them. Connected workflows. Shared data. Eliminated handoffs.

## [📊 Take the AI Tools Assessment](https://futureofpmm.com/ai-survey.html)

### Help Us Build the Roadmap

We're collecting data on:
- What AI tools you're currently using
- What's working and what's not
- Where the gaps are

Combined with Gartner's survey results, we'll map everything against Defend/Extend/Upend to create a prioritized transformation plan.

## [🛠️ Tool of the Week](https://futureofpmm.com/ai-tools.html)

### [Copy.ai](https://copy.ai) — GTM AI Platform

Since content creation is now firmly in "AI-led" territory per Gartner's framework, let's look at a tool leading that shift.

**[Copy.ai](https://copy.ai)** goes beyond basic content generation — it's positioning itself as a full GTM AI platform with workflows that span content, competitive intel, and sales enablement.

**Why it fits the framework:**
- Content generation: Fully AI-led (Defend tier)
- Sales emails: AI-led with human approval
- Workflows connect multiple activities (hints at Extend)

**Real use case:** Automated battlecard updates that feed sales playbooks without manual intervention.
