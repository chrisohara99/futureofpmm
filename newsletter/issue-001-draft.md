## 📝 Friday Note

Happy Friday, PMMs.

This week felt like a turning point. Anthropic's Claude Cowork updates sent software stocks tumbling, and suddenly every exec wants to talk about AI strategy. If you're a product marketer in 2026, you're not just marketing products — you're marketing in an industry that's actively reshaping itself.

Let's get into it.
