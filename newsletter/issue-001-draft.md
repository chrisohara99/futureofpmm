# The Future of PMM
## Issue #1 — Friday, February 14, 2026

---

## 📝 Friday Note

This week I sat down with **David Yockelson**, a Research VP and Gartner Fellow who leads their product marketing practice. The conversation gave me the clearest framework I've seen for thinking about where and how to deploy AI across PMM activities.

The big insight? **Not all AI investments are equal** — and the framework he walked me through (Defend / Extend / Upend) maps different activities to different competitive ambitions, return profiles, and investment levels.

We're also running two surveys right now — Gartner's and [our own AI Tools assessment](https://futureofpmm.com/ai-survey.html). Take both if you haven't already. We'll use the results to build a prioritized transformation roadmap.

## 📋 Action Required: Gartner Product Marketing Skills Assessment

As Dan mentioned, we've partnered with Gartner to conduct a brief, anonymous skills assessment that benchmarks our function against other technology organizations.

**The assessment covers 18 product marketing activities across five core areas:**
- Understanding the market
- Knowing your audience
- Communicating value
- Enabling go-to-market teams
- Managing product marketing teams

This is not a performance review or individual evaluation, so please be open with your responses as it will help us calibrate and identify the PMM capabilities training we need to provide to you.

**To reiterate:**
- ✅ Individual responses are anonymous; we will not see who selected which answers.
- ✅ Gartner will only know if someone participated, not your individual responses.
- ✅ Your input directly informs our priorities for capability development, tooling, and enablement.

**You should have received an email from Gartner yesterday** inviting you to complete the Product Marketing Score assessment. Please take the time to complete it if you haven't already.
