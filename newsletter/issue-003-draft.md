## Welcome to Week 3

This week we focus on **the agentic shift** — and what it means when your buyer stops being a person and starts being an algorithm.

I've been thinking about this for months, but this week I finally wrote it down: the uncomfortable truth that everything we assume about product marketing — personas, messaging hierarchies, content-to-conversion pipelines — breaks when an AI agent is doing the evaluation.

We also spotlight someone who's already building for this future: **Hyunsoo "Soo" Shim**, whose BattleCoach prototype shows what competitive intelligence looks like when it's designed for scale.

Let's get into it.

## 📖 This Week's Essays

### Your Buyer Just Hired an Agent. Now What?
*Part 1 of the Agentic PMM Series*

Here's the uncomfortable truth most product marketers haven't internalized yet: your buyer is disappearing.

Not literally — there are still humans making decisions. But increasingly, those humans are deploying agents to do the work that used to land them on your website, in your webinar, or on your SDR's calendar.

This essay digs into:
- **Why the old frameworks are broken** — personas, SEO, content marketing all assumed human discovery patterns
- **The K-shaped future** — the widening gap between AI-native PMMs and everyone else
- **Discoverability as the new battleground** — what happens when agents don't use Google
- **MCP vs. end-to-end activation** — two strategic paths forward

This is Part 1. More coming.

### 🏆 User of the Week: Hyunsoo "Soo" Shim
*Building an AI Sales Simulator That Thinks Like a PMM*

While most PMMs are using AI to write emails faster, Soo is building **BattleCoach** — an agentic AI prototype that transforms static competitive content into dynamic coaching for sellers.

The insight that sparked it: *"Our competitive messaging often fails the logo swap test."* If you can swap your logo for a competitor's and the messaging still works, you don't have differentiation.

Her approach: a 3-day workshop to create **9 solution-level playbooks** (3 buying scenarios × 3 competitors), then encode that intelligence into an AI system that can scale.

The Crawl → Walk → Run roadmap:
- **Crawl:** Structured competitive intelligence framework
- **Walk:** Context-aware AI co-pilot  
- **Run:** Autonomous competitive coaching

What makes this different from most AI experiments? She's not just building a tool. She's rethinking the entire model of how competitive intelligence gets delivered to the field.

## 📰 News Roundup

**1. OpenAI Turns ChatGPT Into an Ad Platform**
800 million users just became the product. OpenAI's February announcement validated what many predicted: every AI assistant builder is now an ad company. What this means for PMMs: your brand's presence in AI-mediated conversations just became a paid media question.

**2. Salesforce Spring 2026: AI Agents Across CRM**
Salesforce expanded Agentforce with new autonomous agents for marketing, sales, and service. The agents can now handle multi-step workflows without human intervention. The race to embed agentic capabilities into enterprise software is officially on.

**3. Oracle Launches Role-Based AI Agents**
Oracle is betting that role-based agents — not standalone tools — will let revenue teams cut through data silos. New agents for marketers, sellers, and CS teams can pull context from across Fusion applications. The "unified platform" wars just got an AI dimension.

**4. Google Announces AI Mode Checkout Protocols**
Google introduced standards allowing AI agents to complete purchases directly within its ecosystem. Translation: buyer agents can now transact without human involvement. If your checkout flow isn't agent-friendly, you're invisible.

**5. B2BMX 2026: Welcome to the "Infinite Content Graveyard"**
The Demand Gen Report's conference preview says it plainly: "AI-powered is no longer a differentiator—it's the baseline." Every whitepaper sounds the same. Every LinkedIn outreach feels like a robot talking to a robot. The new question: what actually breaks through?

## That's a Wrap

The agentic shift is real, and it's happening faster than most marketing orgs realize. The question isn't whether AI will change product marketing — it's whether you'll be the one shaping that change or reacting to it.

See you next Friday.
