# The Future of PMM

## 📝 Friday Note

Happy Valentine's Day! 💝

This week I had the chance to sit down with **David Yockelson**, a Research VP and Gartner Fellow who leads their product marketing practice. The conversation gave me the clearest framework I've seen for thinking about where and how to deploy AI across PMM activities.

The big insight? **Not all AI investments are equal** — and the framework he walked me through (Defend / Extend / Upend) maps different activities to different competitive ambitions, return profiles, and investment levels.

We're also running two surveys right now — Gartner's and [our own AI Tools assessment](https://futureofpmm.com/ai-survey.html). Take both if you haven't already. We'll use the results to build a prioritized transformation roadmap.

Enjoy!

## [⚡ Featured: What Gartner Gets Right About AI in Product Marketing](https://futureofpmm.com/gartner-ai-product-marketing.html)

### And the One Thing They're Missing

I sat down with **David Yockelson** — a Research VP and Gartner Fellow who leads Gartner's product marketing practice — to figure out how we should think about deploying AI agents across our teams.

**The Framework: Defend / Extend / Upend**

Gartner maps PMM activities into three buckets based on competitive ambition:

🛡️ **Defend** (Parity)
- Augmenting individual productivity
- Content generation lives here
- Investment: ~$500/worker/year (Copilot tier)
- Return: "Return on Employee"

📈 **Extend** (Differentiation)  
- Transforming processes for competitive advantage
- Example: AI-powered continuous competitive intel
- Investment: $250K - $5M (project-level)
- Return: Actual financial ROI

🚀 **Upend** (Disruption)
- Creating new products, markets, value props
- Cross-functional GTM workflows, agentic AI
- Investment: $20M - $250M+
- Return: "Return on Future"

**Key Insight:** Each PMM activity has its own trajectory. Content = AI-led now. Persona development = build, don't buy. ICP refinement = human-led migrating to hybrid.

**The real prize?** Not the activities themselves — it's what happens *between* them. Connected workflows. Shared data. Eliminated handoffs.

### Help Us Build the Roadmap

We're collecting data on:
- What AI tools you're currently using
- What's working and what's not
- Where the gaps are

Combined with Gartner's survey results, we'll map everything against Defend/Extend/Upend to create a prioritized transformation plan.

## [🛠️ Tool of the Week](https://futureofpmm.com/ai-tools.html)

### [Copy.ai](https://copy.ai) — GTM AI Platform

Since content creation is now firmly in "AI-led" territory per Gartner's framework, let's look at a tool leading that shift.

**[Copy.ai](https://copy.ai)** goes beyond basic content generation — it's positioning itself as a full GTM AI platform with workflows that span content, competitive intel, and sales enablement.

**Why it fits the framework:**
- Content generation: Fully AI-led (Defend tier)
- Sales emails: AI-led with human approval
- Workflows connect multiple activities (hints at Extend)

**Real use case:** Automated battlecard updates that feed sales playbooks without manual intervention.
