## 1. FRIDAY NOTE (Week in Review)

Welcome back to The Future of PMM!

This week I ran an experiment: I gave three AI tools the same brief and asked them to create a presentation. The results surprised me — and they should matter to every PMM thinking about their AI workflow.

**The test:** Two articles, one SAP template, instructions to combine them into a two-chapter deck.

**The tools:** Claude, ChatGPT, and Prezent (an enterprise presentation AI).

**The winner:** Claude, by a mile. Zero manual work required. It pulled images from the source articles and wove a coherent narrative. ChatGPT produced 30 slides of bad design. Prezent's "enterprise features" were impossible to access.

**The lesson:** General-purpose LLMs are beating specialized tools on their own turf. If you're evaluating AI for content work, read the full breakdown.

## 4. NEWS ROUNDUP

### 🎯 "AI Agents Can Draft Your Launch Narrative Before Lunch"
*AdWeek's 10 AI Marketing Trends for 2026*

The uncomfortable truth emerging from Davos: when an AI agent can draft positioning, pressure test messaging, and spin 10 campaign variants before noon, the question isn't "will PMMs be replaced?" but "what does human expertise mean now?"

**PMM takeaway:** Role confusion is already hitting strategists. The winners are those organizing *around* AI, not just using it.

### 💰 ChatGPT Gets Ads — Trust Is Now Marketing's Problem

OpenAI's ad rollout in ChatGPT marks a pivotal shift. Marketing will be accountable when customers ask: is this recommendation organic or paid?

**PMM takeaway:** If you touch AI-powered customer experiences, you're inheriting ethical risk.

### 📉 Good Ideas Just Got Cheaper

AI-native creative is flooding the market. Content volume is nearly free now, which means "good enough" creative collapses in value. What's scarce: taste, cultural relevance, and restraint.

**PMM takeaway:** Differentiation comes from judgment, not output volume.

### ⚡ Gartner: 40% of Enterprise Apps Will Have AI Agents by Year-End

The shift isn't "AI tools" → it's "AI agents that operate." If your team runs campaigns like a relay race between specialists, you'll be outperformed by orgs running a "control room" overseeing agentic workflows.
