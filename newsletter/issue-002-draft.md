## 1. FRIDAY NOTE

Welcome back to The Future of PMM!

This week I went deep on competitive battlecards — one of the most underrated weapons in a PMM's arsenal. Then I put AI to the test to see which tool could actually help build one.

**The result:** A practical guide plus a head-to-head showdown that might change which AI you reach for next.

Let's get into it.

## 2. FEATURED: How to Build Competitive Battlecards That Actually Win Deals

![Battlecards Guide](https://futureofpmm.com/assets/images/demo-one/img-03.jpg)

Most battlecards collect dust in a SharePoint folder. They're either too generic to be useful or too detailed to be remembered.

I put together **a practical guide** with real-world examples from the Application Data Cloud wars — SAP vs. Oracle vs. Salesforce vs. Workday.

**What's inside:**
- 🎯 The 5 sections every battlecard needs
- ⚔️ Head-to-head positioning frameworks
- 🛡️ Objection handling that actually works
- 📋 A template you can steal

**The goal:** Battlecards your sellers will actually use.

## 3. FEATURED: I Compared ChatGPT and Claude on Competitive Analysis

![AI Showdown](https://futureofpmm.com/assets/images/demo-one/img-05.jpg)

I gave ChatGPT and Claude the exact same prompt: "Build me a competitive battlecard for SAP's Business Data Cloud."

**Same prompt. Dramatically different results.**

One delivered a polished 9-slide presentation with specific competitive intel, objection handling, and situational guidance. The other gave me a 7-page text document that read like meeting notes.

**The scorecard:**
| Dimension | ChatGPT | Claude |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Tactical Usefulness | 30 | 90 ✓ |
| Competitive Intel | 20 | 85 ✓ |
| Sales Readiness | 25 | 80 ✓ |
| Objection Handling | 0 | 85 ✓ |

**The winner:** Claude, by a mile.

But here's the catch — you still need to verify everything. AI can hallucinate competitive details with unsettling confidence.

## 4. QUICK TAKES

### 🎯 AI Tools Have "Personalities"

The battlecard test revealed something important: ChatGPT leans strategic and conceptual. Claude leans tactical and detailed.

**The lesson:** Know which tool to use for which task. Battlecards? Claude. Market positioning frameworks? Maybe ChatGPT. Or try both and compare.

---

### 💡 The Verification Problem

AI-generated competitive intel is plausible but unverified. Did Salesforce really acquire Informatica for $8B? Is Oracle's rebrand date accurate?

**PMM takeaway:** AI is a first draft, not a finished product. Build verification into your workflow.

### 📊 Coming Soon: Competitive Intel Tools

Next up on my radar: **Klue, Crayon, and Kompyte** — the dedicated competitive intelligence platforms.

Can they beat a well-prompted Claude? Stay tuned.

## 5. TOOL OF THE WEEK: Claude for Sales Enablement

**What it is:** Anthropic's AI assistant (claude.ai)

**Why it's useful for PMMs:** Unlike ChatGPT, Claude seems to intuitively understand the format and depth that sales enablement content requires. It delivered:
- Professional slide structure
- Specific competitive intelligence
- Objection handling with rebuttals
- Situational "when to use this" guidance

**The catch:** Claude can still hallucinate. Verify everything before sharing with sales.

**Try it:** Give Claude your competitive brief and see what happens.
