# The PMM's Guide to AI Tools
## How to Evaluate, Test, and Deploy AI for Your Team

*A practical framework for product marketers navigating the AI tools landscape*

---

## Why This Guide Exists

There are hundreds of AI tools claiming to revolutionize product marketing. Most won't. Some will waste your budget. A few will genuinely transform how you work.

This guide isn't a "top 10 AI tools" listicle. It's a practical framework to help you:

1. **Evaluate** which tools are worth your time
2. **Test** them effectively before committing budget
3. **Deploy** them in a way that actually sticks
4. **Measure** whether they're delivering real value

We'll cover specific tools, but the goal is to give you a repeatable process — not just a shopping list.

## Part 1: The Evaluation Framework

Before looking at any specific tool, answer these questions:

### 1. What Problem Are You Actually Solving?

Start with the pain, not the tool. Common PMM pain points that AI can address:

| Pain Point | AI Solution Category | Example Tools |
|------------|---------------------|---------------|
| "I spend 2+ hours on first drafts" | Content generation | ChatGPT, Claude, Jasper |
| "Competitive intel is always stale" | CI automation | Klue, Crayon, Perplexity |
| "Our messaging isn't consistent" | Brand voice tools | Writer, Jasper Brand Voice |
| "Research synthesis takes forever" | Analysis/summarization | Claude, NotebookLM |
| "Sales asks for the same content repeatedly" | Sales enablement | Seismic, Highspot + AI |

**🚫 Red flag:** If you can't articulate the specific problem, you're not ready to buy a tool.

### 2. Build vs. Buy vs. Prompt

Not every problem needs a dedicated tool:

**Prompt (Free/Cheap):** Can you solve this with ChatGPT/Claude + a good prompt template?
- ✅ One-off tasks, variable inputs
- ✅ Exploration phase
- Example: Generating messaging variations

**Buy (Subscription):** Does this need specialized training, integrations, or workflow automation?
- ✅ Recurring high-volume tasks
- ✅ Team-wide consistency needed
- ✅ Integration with existing tools
- Example: Competitive intelligence monitoring

**Build (Custom):** Is this so specific to your business that nothing off-the-shelf works?
- ✅ Proprietary data/processes
- ✅ Unique compliance requirements
- Example: Custom product configurator assistant

### 3. The 5-Question Tool Evaluation

For any tool you're seriously considering:

1. **What does it do that ChatGPT/Claude can't?**
   - If the answer is "nothing much," save your money
   
2. **Who else on the team would use this?**
   - Single-user tools rarely justify the cost
   
3. **What's the learning curve?**
   - Complex tools with low adoption = wasted budget
   
4. **How does it integrate with our stack?**
   - Standalone tools create friction
   
5. **What's the real total cost?**
   - Seats, overages, training time, IT overhead

## Part 2: Testing Playbooks

### The 2-Week Pilot Framework

Don't commit to annual contracts based on a demo. Run a structured pilot:

**Week 1: Learn**
- Day 1-2: Setup, basic training
- Day 3-5: Use for real tasks (not toy examples)
- Document: What works? What's frustrating?

**Week 2: Stress Test**
- Day 6-8: Push the edge cases
- Day 9-10: Have others try it (fresh eyes)
- Document: Would you miss this if it disappeared?

**Decision Criteria:**
- ⏱️ Did it save measurable time? (Track it)
- 📈 Was the output quality acceptable? (Grade samples)
- 😤 Was the friction worth it? (Be honest)
- 💰 Does the ROI math work? (Do the calculation)

### Testing by Category

#### General AI Assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
**Test:** Give all three the same complex PMM task (e.g., "Create a competitive positioning framework for [product] against [3 competitors]")
**Evaluate:** Quality, speed, follow-up capability, context retention
**Timeline:** 1 week of daily use

#### Content Generation (Jasper, Copy.ai, Writer)
**Test:** Generate 10 pieces of the same content type you produce regularly
**Evaluate:** % usable without major edits, brand voice match, time saved
**Timeline:** 2 weeks, minimum 20 outputs

#### Competitive Intelligence (Klue, Crayon, Kompyte)
**Test:** Set up monitoring for 3 key competitors
**Evaluate:** Signal-to-noise ratio, actionability of alerts, integration with your workflow
**Timeline:** 30 days (CI tools need time to show value)

#### Research/Analysis (Perplexity, NotebookLM, Elicit)
**Test:** Use for 5 real research tasks you'd normally do manually
**Evaluate:** Accuracy (verify claims), source quality, time saved
**Timeline:** 2 weeks

## Part 3: The Tool Landscape

### Tier 1: Start Here

These tools have the highest probability of delivering value for most PMMs:

#### ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro — $20/month

### Tier 3: Emerging/Niche

Keep an eye on, but don't rush to adopt:

| Tool | Use Case | Why Wait |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Gamma** | AI presentations | Good for drafts, not final decks |
| **Descript** | Video editing | Learning curve, niche use case |
| **Otter.ai** | Meeting transcription | Many alternatives, check what you have |
| **Copy.ai** | GTM workflows | Overlap with general AI tools |

---

## Part 4: Deployment That Sticks

### The Adoption Curve

Most AI tool rollouts fail not because of the tool, but because of the rollout:

**Week 1-2: Champion Phase**
- Start with 2-3 enthusiastic users
- Document wins and workflows
- Create initial prompt templates

**Week 3-4: Expand Phase**
- Add 5-10 more users
- Run a 30-minute training session
- Share the documented workflows

**Month 2+: Normalize Phase**
- Make it part of standard processes
- Include in onboarding
- Track usage and gather feedback

### Common Failure Modes

❌ **"Here's the tool, figure it out"**
→ ✅ Provide specific use cases and templates

❌ **"Everyone must use this"**
→ ✅ Start with volunteers, let success spread

❌ **"This replaces your judgment"**
→ ✅ Position as assistant, not replacement

❌ **"Set it and forget it"**
→ ✅ Schedule monthly check-ins on what's working

## Part 5: Measuring Success

### Metrics That Matter

**Time Savings**
- Hours saved per week per person
- Baseline: Track before implementing

**Quality Indicators**
- Edit rounds required (fewer = better AI output)
- Stakeholder satisfaction scores
- Error/revision rates

**Adoption Metrics**
- Weekly active users
- Tasks completed with AI assistance
- Prompt library usage

### ROI Calculation Template

```
Monthly tool cost: $___
Hours saved per month: ___ hours
Your hourly rate (fully loaded): $___
Monthly value created: ___ hours × $___/hour = $___
ROI: (Value - Cost) / Cost = ___%
```

**Rule of thumb:** If a tool doesn't pay for itself in time savings within 2 months, reconsider.
