The AI tool landscape for product marketers is maturing fast. Here are five worth your attention:

## 1. Jasper's PMM Templates

Jasper released dedicated product marketing templates — positioning statements, battle cards, release notes. The output still needs human polish, but the first draft speed is real.

**Best for:** Teams drowning in launch content.

## 2. Klue + GPT Integration

Klue's competitive intelligence platform now auto-summarizes competitor moves. Feed it a press release, get a battle card update in seconds.

**Best for:** CI-heavy orgs tired of manual tracking.

## 3. Notion AI for Product Briefs

Notion's AI can now generate product brief drafts from bullet points. Write your key messages, get a structured brief back.

**Best for:** Solo PMMs who need to move fast.

## 4. Descript for Demo Videos

AI-powered video editing that lets you edit video by editing text. Record a rough demo, fix mistakes by retyping words.

**Best for:** PMMs who create their own demo content.

## 5. ChatGPT + Custom Instructions

Still underrated: a well-tuned ChatGPT with your product context, ICP, and messaging pillars as custom instructions. Free and flexible.

**Best for:** Everyone — it's table stakes now.

## The Pattern

Notice what these tools have in common: they automate the *assembly* of content, not the *thinking* behind it. The PMM who knows what to say still wins. The PMM who only knows how to say it is in trouble.
