Here's what's shaking up product marketing this week:

## 🛠 Anthropic's "Cowork" Gets Marketing Plugins

Anthropic expanded its Cowork tool with domain-specific plugins including marketing, sales, and product management. Think: AI as a specialized PMM co-pilot that can help with positioning docs, competitive analysis, and go-to-market strategy.

**PMM implication:** Dedicated AI assistants for marketing work are becoming productized, not just prompt-hacked.

## 💼 AI Blamed for 54,694 Job Cuts in 2025

November alone saw 6,280 layoffs attributed to AI. Marketing roles are quietly in the mix. The conversation is shifting from "AI assists" to "AI replaces" for content creation, basic research, and reporting tasks.

**Smart move:** PMMs are repositioning as AI orchestrators, not just content creators.

## 🔮 "Not Providing AI Isn't an Option"

DocuSign CEO Allan Thygesen went on record saying AI features are now table stakes. For PMMs, this means every product launch story needs an AI angle. If your product doesn't have one, you're already on defense in competitive deals.

## 📊 NotebookLM: 7 Use Cases for Marketing Teams

Google's NotebookLM is getting serious traction for research-heavy PMM tasks: competitive intel synthesis, customer research analysis, and turning messy source material into insights. The tool now integrates Deep Research for source verification — huge for building credible battle cards and positioning.

## 🤖 AI Agents That Actually Work

Marketing AI Institute is featuring practical automations at their Agencies Summit — breaking down what agents really are vs. the hype, and which ones deliver ROI.

**Key insight:** "Most agent dreams fall apart" but some use cases (like client research, content repurposing) are production-ready now.

## TL;DR for PMMs

The tools are getting specific (plugins, agents), the job cuts are real, and "AI-powered" is now an expectation, not a differentiator. 

**The winning move:** Use AI to do the grunt work faster so you can focus on strategy and storytelling that machines still can't touch.
