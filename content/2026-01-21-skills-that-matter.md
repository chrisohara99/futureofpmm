Every week brings a new "AI will replace marketers" headline. Let's cut through the noise and talk about what actually matters.

## What AI Does Well Now

- **Content generation:** First drafts, variations, repurposing
- **Research synthesis:** Summarizing competitor news, analyst reports
- **Data formatting:** Turning spreadsheets into narratives
- **Template filling:** Battle cards, one-pagers, email sequences

If your job is mostly these tasks, yes — you should be concerned.

## What AI Still Can't Do

### 1. Customer Intuition

AI can analyze what customers *said*. It can't sit in a sales call and feel the hesitation when pricing comes up. It can't read the room in a focus group. That intuition comes from reps, and it's irreplaceable.

### 2. Internal Politics Navigation

Getting engineering to prioritize your launch feature. Convincing the CEO that the messaging needs to change. Managing the PM who thinks they're the PMM. This is human work.

### 3. Strategic Sequencing

*What* do we launch first? *When* do we go upmarket? *How* do we position against the new entrant without acknowledging them? These decisions require judgment AI doesn't have.

### 4. Brand Voice (Real Brand Voice)

AI can mimic tone. It can't create the authentic voice that comes from knowing your company's soul — the jokes that land, the phrases that feel right, the lines you'd never cross.

## The Career Play

Double down on:
- Customer proximity (calls, visits, research)
- Cross-functional influence
- Strategic planning
- Executive communication

Offload to AI:
- First drafts
- Research summaries
- Routine updates

The PMMs who thrive will be **AI-augmented strategists**, not content factories.
